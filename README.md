# Laryngoscope-Practice-Analysis
## Introduction
A laryngoscope is a medical instrument which is used to examine the larynx(voice box) during a laryngoscopy. It has lights and a lens, and can be used during intubation to insert a breathing tube in a patient who is having difficulty breathing.
## Objective
This project aims to analyse the Laryngoscope dataset in R which comes from a study by Abdullah et al., published in Anasthesia Analgesia in 2011. The dataset is part of the medicaldata package. It compares the Pentax AWS Video Laryngoscope and the Macintosh Laryngoscope.
