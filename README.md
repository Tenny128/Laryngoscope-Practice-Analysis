# Laryngoscope-Practice-Analysis
## Introduction
A laryngoscope is a medical instrument which is used to examine the larynx(voice box) during a laryngoscopy. It has lights and a lens, and can be used during intubation to insert a breathing tube in a patient who is having difficulty breathing.
## Objective
This project aims to analyse the Laryngoscope dataset in R which comes from a study by Abdullah et al., published in Anasthesia Analgesia in 2011. The dataset is part of the medicaldata package. It compares the Pentax AWS Video Laryngoscope and the Macintosh Laryngoscope.
## Analytic Process
I set up the environment by installing and loading tidyverse. I also installed the medicaldata in R datasets, so as to gain access to the Laryngoscope data for this analysis.
I saved the data as a tibble called 't_laryngoscope'.
The data columns are all presented as numerical data. In order to be able to explore the data using charts, I converted some of the columns to categorical data.
Using scatter plots and bar charts I explored the data for significant insights.

## Insights
Both the Pentax AWS Video Laryngoscope and the Macintosh Laryngoscope are very effective in use during inturbation.
Easier intubations are more likely to take less time and require only one attempt.
Bleeding can occur even when the glottic view is good. However occurence of bleeding seems to be very few.
